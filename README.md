 ## Python Flask Expert Assistant

### Problem Analysis
The problem presented is to design a Flask application for a physical therapy clinic's website. This website will provide information about the clinic, its services, and allow users to book appointments.

### Flask Application Design
The Flask application will consist of the following components:

#### HTML Files
- `index.html`: This will be the homepage of the website and will provide an overview of the clinic and its services.
- `services.html`: This page will provide detailed information about the various services offered by the clinic.
- `appointment.html`: This page will allow users to book appointments with the clinic.
- `contact.html`: This page will provide contact information for the clinic.

#### Routes
- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file.
- `/services`: This route will render the `services.html` file.
- `/appointment`: This route will render the `appointment.html` file.
- `/contact`: This route will render the `contact.html` file.

### Explanation
The HTML files will provide the user interface for the website. The routes will define the different pages of the website and will handle the user requests.

The `index.html` file will serve as the landing page for the website and will provide a brief overview of the clinic and its services. The `services.html` file will provide more detailed information about the various services offered by the clinic. The `appointment.html` file will allow users to book appointments with the clinic. The `contact.html` file will provide contact information for the clinic.

The routes defined in the Flask application will handle the user requests and render the appropriate HTML files. For example, when a user visits the root URL (`/`), the `/` route will be triggered and the `index.html` file will be rendered. Similarly, when a user visits the `/services` URL, the `/services` route will be triggered and the `services.html` file will be rendered.

This Flask application design provides a basic structure for a physical therapy clinic's website. It can be further customized and expanded to include additional features and functionality as needed.
